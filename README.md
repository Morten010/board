# ðŸŽ¬ InfoBoard


I have developed an interactive info board for my school that serves as a central hub for students, teachers, and staff to access important information. This web-based application provides a convenient way to stay updated on class schedules, cafeteria menus, news updates, and other relevant information.

The info board also features a news section where school announcements, events, and other relevant updates are displayed. Users can stay informed about important dates, deadlines, and any changes happening within the school community.
